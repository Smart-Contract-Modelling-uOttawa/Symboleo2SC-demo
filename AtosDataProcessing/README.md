# Data Processing Agreement Contract
This folder contains the generated smart contract of the data processing agreement contract by the Symboleo2SC tool and the generated nuXmv Model generated by SymboleoPC tool.

- [The text summary of the agreement between the client and the data processor company](DataProcessingContractTextSpecification.pdf).
- [The Symboleo specification of this agreement](AtosDataProcessing.symboleo).
- [nuXmv Model of the Data Processing Agreement](DataProcessingAgreement.smv)
# Properties checking
To check the contract's liveness and safety properties:
- Install [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/download.html) 
- copy [nuXmv Model of the Data Processing Agreement](DataProcessingAgreement.smv) and past it into bin directory of the installed nuXmv directory
- in the command Prompt:
- ```
  c:> cd C:\nuXmv-2.0.0-win64\bin
  C:\nuXmv-2.0.0-win64\bin > nuxmv.exe -int C:\nuXmv-2.0.0-win64\bin\DataProcessingAgreement.smv
  C:\nuXmv-2.0.0-win64\bin >go_msat
  > check_ltlspec_ic3 -i
  > quit
  ```
# Smart Contract Testing
To test the generated smart contract using several scenarios illustrated in [DataProcessingAgreement.test.js](DataProcessingAgreement.test.js) :
- First, clone this repository using the `git clone` command or download the zip archive.
- Install visual studio code
- Then, install dependencies.
```shell
cd Symboleo2SC-demo
npm install
```
- To test the generated smart contracts run the below commands:
